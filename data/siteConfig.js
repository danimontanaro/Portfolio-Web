  authorDescription: `I like learning and improving myself every day. When I was a teenager, I knew that the future was going to be all about software and I liked the idea of creating my own pages from scratch.
  In my last job, I have been developing the system used for the whole public health system in Buenos Aires, Argentina. This was a great experience, being able to participate in the build of a massive huge software that is being used by millions of people. 
  I am always doing new courses and reading tech staff. Between my favorite things, I enjoy coding with React JS in the frontend and Python Django in the backend.`,
